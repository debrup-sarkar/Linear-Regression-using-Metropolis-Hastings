# Linear Regression using Metropolis Hastings Algorithm

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method used for sampling from a probability distribution, particularly useful for estimating parameters in Bayesian inference problems. It iteratively proposes new samples based on a proposal distribution, accepting or rejecting them based on an acceptance ratio calculated from the likelihood of the proposed and current samples.

## The model
$y = ax + b + \epsilon $
$\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^{2})$
